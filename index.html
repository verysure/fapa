                FAPA-MA chapter is based in Boston. We work closely with HQ to promote our messages locally in the greater Boston area and Massachusetts.
				<br>
				We have four main goals:
				
				1. Maintain active interactions with the local offices of MA congressmen/women and Senators, to discuss and update the offices with the latest political and cultural development in Taiwan. 
				2. To bridge different Taiwanese communities in Boston/MA (first generation, second generation, and oversea students), hold events to bring the communities together to discuss issues related to Taiwan and US-Taiwan relations.  
				3. Actively reach out to other local student, academic and grassroots activist groups. 
				4. Monthly Keep Taiwan Free Harvard Square outreach to promote the spirit of Taiwan to the public.
